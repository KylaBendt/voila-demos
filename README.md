# voila-demos

The goal of this project is to create a few JupyterLab Notebooks to use in testing and demoing the use of Voila.  

The focus on the design is on creating useful output in Voila.  

Instructions for viewing the notebooks using Voila and Binder can be found here: https://www.kylabendt.com/blog/binder-and-voila-to-display-jupyter-notebooks/
